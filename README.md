# Movie Recommendation System

*Data:* \
The dataset describes ratings and free text tagging activities from MovieLens, a movie-recommendation service. It contains 20M ratings and 465K tag applications across 27K movies. This data was created by 138K users between January 09, 1995 and March 31, 2015. We merged the movies, tags and ratings files to build our system. 

*Problem Statement*\
The main aim of this project was to build a movie recommendation system that gives movie suggestions based on the kind of movies the users have watched and rated. The recommendation system used algorithms:  ALS Matrix Factorization and KNN to recommend movies to users based on various parameters such as tags, genres and ratings.

*Goal of the Project*\
Recommend movies to a user based on tags of movies (Similarity Distance Measure and PCA)
Recommend movies to a user based on ratings (ALS Matrix Factorization)
